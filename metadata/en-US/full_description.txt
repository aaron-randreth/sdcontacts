This app is meant for users that don't want to synchronize their contacts online, but want to keep them local to the phone.
Though there is a problem, if you brick your phone, you might lose all your contacts.
With this app, you will have a backup of your contacts stored on the SD card. You can take it out and import the contacts into your new phone.
